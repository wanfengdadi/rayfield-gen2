// sirius.menu/gen2          -> the current stable release
// sirius.menu/gen2-preview  -> the rolling preview build
//
// Both channels are the same thing: fetch a release asset from GitHub and hand
// it back as plain text for a Roblox HTTP client to loadstring. The split is
// which release they read.
//
// Stable reads `releases/latest`, which GitHub defines as the newest release
// that is NOT a prerelease. That single rule is what keeps the two channels
// apart: a preview is published as a prerelease, so it can never become
// `latest` and can never reach anyone on the stable URL.
//
// Preview reads a rolling `preview` tag whose assets are replaced on every
// build. There is deliberately no history here - the bundle stamps its own
// version and commit into its header, so a report from a preview user still
// points at an exact commit.
